		<h2>Jquery</h2>
		<p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
           jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
           jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.</p>
