		<h2>JavaScript</h2>
		<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), 
        JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, 
        Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by 
        supplementing it with additional objects.</p>
